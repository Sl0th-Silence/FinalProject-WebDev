Part B: Authentication

Every user needs to be authenticated to use the app.
The credentials should be saved in the database and 
authentication will occur on the backend server.
Once a user is authenticated, a cookie token (jwt)
is created and stored in the browser. This token will
confirm authentication to enable routing to the
locked pages, which we will call "private routing".
Once a user logs out, their authentication cookie must
be deleted from the browser and the app's private router
should be locked.

Part C: Private Routing

Routes("/main", "/add-product", "/edit-product") will be
considered private routes. As explained above, you will
need to be authenticated as the "admin" user before
accessing them. Therefore, you will need to design your
routing with this in mind.
